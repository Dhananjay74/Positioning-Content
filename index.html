              Throughout the years, coffee shops and cafés alike have become so
              much more than just a place to acquire a delicious brew. Since the
              first coffee shops were established, they have been used as social
              places to congregate and meeting points for the public. Alongside
              the development of coffee shops came the ‘coffee culture’, a set
              of traditions and rules regarding the way cafes are used, and the
              way these delicious brews are enjoyed.

              Five different threshold designs are available in two different
              heights (40, 57mm) making it possible to have an exposed or fully
              submerged threshold. Optionally the threshold comes with an
              integrated drainage channel which allows the track to be fully
              recessed into the floor while increasing the water permeability.
              The water extraction can also be facilitated through pipes
              directly installed on the track so that a drainage gutter is no
              longer required.
